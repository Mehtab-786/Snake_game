# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Python Turtle graphics library. The game allows the player to control a snake, navigate it through the game window, eat food to grow, and score points. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Features

- Responsive snake movement controlled by arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Colorful representation using Turtle graphics.
- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat.
- Score tracking and display.
- Game over message upon collision.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in Python standard library)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and enjoy the game!

## Code Structure

The project is organized into four main files:

- `main.py`: The main script to run the game, which sets up the game window, handles user input, and controls the game loop.
- `snake.py`: Defines the `Snake` class responsible for managing the snake's behavior, movement, and growth.
- `food.py`: Implements the `Food` class representing the food that the snake consumes, with a method for refreshing its position.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Score` class for tracking and displaying the player's score.
